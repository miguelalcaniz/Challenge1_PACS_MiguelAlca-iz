README should be more detailed.

You could have collected the optimization parameters in a struct.
You could try to use templates to choose the different strategies for the computation of the learning rate and different classes for the minimization methods.
Since you already give the user the possibility to set parameters runtime, you could also let them choose the minimization method: it would make the code more flexible.

Give more meaningful names to variables: avoid names as minimizer1,2,3 and prefer for instance gradientDescent, heavyBall, nesterov.

The results are correct and the output is clear.
